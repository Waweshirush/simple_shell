simple_shell is a collaboratory project where we will be creating a simple UNIX command interpreter./n
Task zero involves us writing a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
In task one, we are writing a UNIX command line interpreter.
For task two, we handle command lines with arguments
For task 3, we handle the PATH
For task 4, we implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
For task 5, we implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
For task 6, we write our own getline function
